As an open-source project, reNgine welcomes any contributions. Your contributions could be as simple as fixing the indentations or fixing UI to as complex as bringing new modules and features.
Your contributions are highly appreciated and we welcome any kind of contributions as long as you adhere to our guidelines and your PR aligns the idea behind creating the reNgine.

If you are new to open source community, reNgine is beginner-friendly. Please create pull requests for any new features, bug fixes, improvements on documentation, or anything!

Join our developer chat on [Discord Developer Room](https://discord.gg/JuhHdHTtwd) if you would like to contribute to reNgine.

## Bug reporting

We appreciate your effort to improve reNgine by submitting a bug report. But, Before doing so, please check the following things:

1. Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests, instead use [reNgine Support Discord channel](https://discord.gg/azv6fzhNCE) for any personal support request.
2. Check whether the bug **hasn't been already reported**. Duplicate reports take us time, that we could be used to fix other bugs or make improvements.
3. If you get an error while using reNgine, please **describe what happened** and add a verbose error message. Reports like "I got an error when I started scanning some random website." are not worth anybody's time. Please be as descriptive as you can.
4. Provide easy steps to reproduce. This will help us solve your issues easily and quickly.
Your contributions are again highly appreciated!

Please report [bugs here on GitHub Issues section][1].

## Feature requests
We welcome feature requests. But please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the original idea behind reEngine. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests
Pull requests with a bug fix, improvements, new features are welcome and very much appreciated.

**Please ask** first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.
